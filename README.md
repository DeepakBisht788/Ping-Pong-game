# Ping Pong Game
This is a simple Ping Pong game developed using Python's `turtle` graphics library. The game features two paddles, a ball, and a scoreboard, allowing two players to play against each other.

## Features
- **Two paddles**: Controlled by the left and right players.
- **Ball movement**: The ball bounces off the walls and paddles.
- **Scoring system**: Points are scored when a player misses the ball.
- **Game over condition**: The game ends when a player reaches the winning score.

## Summary of the Classes:
- `Paddle`: Controls paddle movement up and down.
- `Ball`: Handles ball movement, bouncing, and restarting when a player misses it.
- `Scoreboard`: Tracks and displays the score, as well as the "Game Over" message.
These three classes work together to create the game’s functionality, with the Paddle class handling user input, the Ball class managing the ball’s movement and collisions, and the Scoreboard class displaying the score and determining when the game ends.
